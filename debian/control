Architecture: linux-any
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, dbus
Recommends: fso-deviced-platform
Description: freesmartphone.org device daemon
 fsodeviced implements the freesmartphone.org Device API.
 .
 This API allows peripheral control, such as managing audio, backlight
 brightness, LEDs, Vibrator, Accelerometer, and power control for devices
 without dedicated controlling daemon. It can deal with charging notification
 and RTC, forwarding button events and notifying about the system's idleness
 status.
 .
 This package is part of the freesmartphone.org software stack
 and is targeted for smartphones.
